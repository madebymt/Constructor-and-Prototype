# Constructor-and-Prototype

There will be a series of console statements that you need to make pass in the main.js file. You may not edit the testing functions or the test statements in the tests.js file. It will help to view the tests.js file to take a look at the tests that are running.

You'll be required to write some code in both the Dog and Human constructor as well as create the instances listed with the correct properties.



Set up the model for Prototype and pass the value inside.
